  *** CIRCOS ERROR ***

      cwd:
      /data/liyuejuan/miniconda3/envs/mySVenv_python3/SV_procedure/test/result_stat/circos/s__Anaerobutyricum_hallii

      command: /data/liyuejuan/miniconda3/envs/mySVenv_python2/bin/circos -conf
      circos.conf

  You have asked to draw [212] ideograms, but the maximum is currently set at
  [200]. To increase this number change max_ideograms in etc/housekeeping.conf.
  Keep in mind that drawing that many ideograms may create an image that is too
  busy and uninterpretable.
